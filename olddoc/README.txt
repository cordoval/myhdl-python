Printing problems with pdf
--------------------------

Apparently there is a problem with Acrobat5 and the Python
documentation flow I am using. The symptom is that the some pages of
the MyHDL.pdf file don't print correctly.  The workaround is to print
from Acrobat4, xpdf or ghostview. Alternatively, you can try the
postscript file MyHDL.ps.
