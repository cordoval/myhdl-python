The tests in this directory require a working Icarus installation
(iverilog and vvp commands) or a working Cver installation (cver
command), because co-simulation with Icarus Verilog or Cver is used to
verify the Verilog designs generated by the converter.

Cver is setup by default. You can change that by going into util.py
and using the Icarus definitions for the functions setupCosimulation
and verilogCompile.

The test suite should run without errors or failures with Cver
(GPLCVER_2.11a). However, with Icarus 0.8.1 some tests in test_dec and
test_signed fail. It has been found that Icarus 0.8 is currently
unreliable for signed arithmetic. It has been reported that the issues
are addressed in 0.9 development.
