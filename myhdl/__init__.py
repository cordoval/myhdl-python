""" myhdl package initialization.

This module provides the following myhdl objects:
Simulation -- simulation class
StopStimulation -- exception that stops a simulation
now -- function that returns the current time
Signal -- class to model hardware signals
delay -- callable to model delay in a yield statement
posedge -- callable to model a rising edge on a signal in a yield statement
negedge -- callable to model a falling edge on a signal in a yield statement
join -- callable to join clauses in a yield statement
intbv -- mutable integer class with bit vector facilities
downrange -- function that returns a downward range
