What's new in MyHDL 0.7

Conversion to VHDL/Verilog rewritten with the ``ast`` module
============================================================

The most important code change is a change that hopefully no-one will
notice :-).  The conversion code is now based on the ``ast`` package
instead of the ``compiler`` package.  Since Python 2.6, the
``compiler`` package is deprecated and replaced by the new ``ast``
package in the standard library. In Python 3, the ``compiler``
package is no longer available.

This was a considerable effort, spent on re-implementing existing
behavior instead of on new interesting features.  This sound
unfortunate, but it had to be done with priority.  Now the conversion
code is ready for the future.


Shadow signals
==============

Background
----------

Compared to HDLs such as VHDL and Verilog, MyHDL signals are less
flexible for structural modeling. For example, slicing a signal
returns a slice of the current value. For behavioral code, this is
just fine. However, it implies that you cannot use such as slice in
structural descriptions. In other words, a signal slice cannot be used
as a signal.
