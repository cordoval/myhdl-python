Conversion to VHDL/Verilog rewritten with the ``ast`` module
============================================================

The most important code change, and the one requiring most
of the work, is a change that hopefully no-one will notice :-).
The conversion code is now based on the standard ``ast``
package instead of the old ``compiler`` package.
This was a considerable effort, spent on duplicating existing
behavior rather than on implementing new interesting features.
This sound unfortunate, but it had to be done with priority.
The ``compiler`` package is deprecated in the latest versions
of Python, and replaced by the new ``ast`` package. In Python 3,
the ``compiler`` packages is not longer available.

Now that his has been done, the conversion code is ready
for the future.
