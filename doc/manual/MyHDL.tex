\noindent

\myhdl{} is a Python package for using Python as a hardware description
and verification language. Languages such Verilog and VHDL are
compiled languages. Python with \myhdl{} can be viewed as a "scripting
language" counterpart of such languages. However, Python is more
accurately described as a very high level language (VHLL). \myhdl{} users
have access to the amazing power and elegance of Python.

The key idea behind \myhdl{} is to use Python generators for modeling
hardware concurrency. A generator is a resumable function with
internal state. In \myhdl{}, a hardware module is modeled as a function
that returns generators. With this approach, \myhdl{} directly supports
features such as named port association, arrays of instances, and
conditional instantiation. 

\myhdl{} supports the classic hardware description concepts.  It provides
a signal class similar to the VHDL signal, a class for bit oriented
operations, and support for enumeration types.  The Python
\code{yield} statement is used as a general sensitivity list to
wait on a signal change, an edge, a delay, or on another
generator. \myhdl{} supports waveform viewing by tracing signal changes
in a VCD file.

Python's rare combination of power and clarity makes it ideal for high
level modeling.  It can be expected that \myhdl{} users will often
have the ``Pythonic experience'' of finding an elegant solution to a
complex modeling problem. Moreover, Python is outstanding for rapid
application development and experimentation.

With \myhdl{}, the Python unit test framework can be used on hardware
designs.  \myhdl{} can also be used as hardware verification language for
VHDL and Verilog designs, by co-simulation with any simulator that has
a PLI.  The distribution contains a PLI module for the
Icarus Verilog simulator.

The \myhdl{} software is open source software. It is licensed under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
